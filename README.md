# SFER_code
This is the code for paper "Unsupervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation via Shared Fuzzy Equivalence Relations", published in IEEE TFS.
Please NOTE: If you do not use windows system, you need to re-compile your own svmtrain and svmpredict file using LibSVM package (available in https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).

We transfer knowledge from a heterogeneous source domain to an unlabeled target domain.

If you do not want to repalce with your datasets, just run

main;

in your MATLAB. We use MATLAB 2017a to run this code.

If you want to use your own datasets, your should change lines 13-14 and lines 28-29 in the main.m

If you use this code, please cite the following paper:
